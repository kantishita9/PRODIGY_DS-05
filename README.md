![Task5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f29d906-96dd-4ca6-aaf1-67ed38237002)

# Overview
This project is part of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship program. In Task 5, the focus is on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival.

# Dataset
The analysis utilizes the Titanic dataset, which provides information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, including features like age, gender, class, and survival status. The dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks.

# EDA Highlights
* Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and corrected data types.
* Univariate Analysis: Examined individual features such as age distribution, gender counts, and class distribution.
* Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between features, such as survival rates across different classes and genders.
* Visualization: Employed libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative plots that illustrate key findings.

# Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

# Knowledge Gained
Gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Learned to draw meaningful insights from real-world data through exploratory analysis.

# Conclusion
This EDA provides valuable insights into the factors affecting passenger survival on the Titanic. The findings can serve as a foundation for further predictive modeling and analysis.

Thanks for the reviewing.
